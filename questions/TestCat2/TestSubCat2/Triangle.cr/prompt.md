A triangle's area can be calculated using the following formula:

$$area = base * height / 2$$

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the base and height of a triangle in centimetres.  The program should
then print the area of the rectangle to two decimal places.

Refer to the example testcases below for the required prompts and format of the message to be displayed with rectangle area.

Note: The two values entered can be floating point values and will be valid non-negative numbers.
