<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The process to write CodeRunner questions with Moodle is difficult and the number of options makes question creation long and tedious. This means that teaching staff spend large amounts of time working simply writing out the questions, and the process leads to a high incidence of question errors.

Based on <a href="https://github.com/James-Ansley/moodle-toml">Toodle</a> by <a href="https://github.com/James-Ansley">@James-Ansley</a>, `FiNoodle` by Finale supports various question types (including CodeRunner, short answer, multiple choice, etc.) and provide warnings for common errors in generating questions. FiNoodle also various supports question templates to generate questions in a consistent and precise format.
